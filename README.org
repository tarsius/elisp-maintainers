* Elisp maintainers and how to support them

This is a list of maintainers of Emacs packages, their projects, and
how to support them.  Obviously it is very incomplete, I have only
quickly added a few maintainers whose donation pages were easy^1 to
find and added a longer entry for myself to demonstrate what
information I would like to see collected here.  Please add yourself^2
and the maintainers of your favorite packages and open a pull request.

_1 That's actually quite time consuming, which is why we need this
list.

_2 Don't be shy.

Eventually we could create an Emacs package and/or a webpage using the
information collected here, but for now I am concentrating on the data
collection.

Please sort alphabetically to avoid duplicates.

Only add entries for maintainers for whom at least one donation option
is known.  You can also add an entry for *yourself* if you don't accept
any donations but would like users to donate to charity instead (make
that explicit).
