* Elisp maintainers and how to support them

This is a list of maintainers of Emacs packages, their projects, and
how to support them.  Obviously it is very incomplete, I have only
quickly added a few maintainers whose donation pages were easy^1 to
find and added a longer entry for myself to demonstrate what
information I would like to see collected here.  Please add yourself^2
and the maintainers of your favorite packages and open a pull request.

_1 That's actually quite time consuming, which is why we need this
list.

_2 Don't be shy.

Eventually we could create an Emacs package and/or a webpage using the
information collected here, but for now I am concentrating on the data
collection.

Please sort alphabetically to avoid duplicates.
